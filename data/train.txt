compared O
with O
standard B-Process
algorithms I-Process
. O
In O
particular, O
we O
found O
that O
dynamic B-Process
aggregation I-Process
of I-Process
models I-Process
built O
from O
very O
little O
extracted O
data O
by O
D-SDC B-Process
is O
effective O
for O
compatibility O
of O
high O
prediction O
performance O
and O
low O
computational O
complexity. O
However, O
there O
are O
problems O
to O
be O
solved O
in O
SW-SVR B-Process
. O
Firstly, O
the O
prediction O
performance O
of O
SW-SVR B-Process
sometimes O
deteriorates O
despite O
an O
increase O
of O
training B-Material
data I-Material
. O
In O
particular, O
this O
problem O
occurred O
under O
the O
conditions O
that O
prediction O
horizons O
are O
6 O
h O
as O
shown O
in O
Fig. O
3. O
This O
is O
because O
data O
extracted O
by O
D-SDC B-Process
involves O
unnecessary O
training B-Material
data I-Material
for O
highly O
accurate O
prediction. O
If O
D-SDC B-Process
extracts O
the O
same O
data O
as O
the O
extracted O
data O
when O
training O
periods O
are O
shorter, O
the O
prediction O
performance O
of O
SW-SVR B-Process
never O
deteriorates O
due O
to O
an O
increase O
of O
training B-Material
data I-Material
. O
Therefore, O
we O
must O
review O
both O
feature O
mapping O
and O
algorithms O
of O
D-SDC B-Process
so O
as O
to O
avoid O
extracting O
unnecessary O
training O
data. O
Meanwhile, O
SW-SVR B-Process
is O
based O
on O
a O
combination B-Process
of I-Process
several I-Process
algorithms I-Process
: O
kernel B-Process
approximation I-Process
, O
PLS B-Process
regression I-Process
, O
k-means B-Process
, O
D-SDC B-Process
, O
and O
linear B-Process
SVR I-Process
. O
Moreover, O
each O
algorithm O
has O
several O
parameters. O
Therefore, O
SW-SVR B-Process
has O
more O
varied O
parameters, O
and O
it O
takes O
more O
time O
to O
tune B-Process
the I-Process
parameters I-Process
. O
In O
this O
experiment, O
we O
used O
a O
grid B-Process
search I-Process
roughly O
so O
as O
to O
decide O
the O
parameters O
in O
a O
certain O
time. O
However, O
there O
is O
still O
room O
for O
improvement O
in O

[17] O

the O

a O
large O

When O

the O

the O

Up O
to O
now, O
morphological B-Task

The O
biggest O
advantage O
of O
microscopy B-Task
is O
that O
they O
provide O

morphologies. O
However, O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
“measurements”, O
especially O
in O
a O
quantitative O
way, O
microscopy B-Task
sometimes O
lacks O
a O
statistical O
accuracy O
due O
to O
the O
small O
field O

view. O
In O
contrast, O
the O
scattering B-Process
methods I-Process
provide O
much O
a O
superior O
statistical O
accuracy O
than O
that O
of O
microscopy B-Task
simply O
because O
the O
observation O
volume O
is O
larger O
than O
that O
of O
the O
microscopes B-Material
. O
One O
must O
remember, O
however, O
that O
the O
scattering B-Process
methods I-Process
normally O
require O
e: B-Process
They I-Process
do I-Process
not I-Process
provide I-Process

does O

After O
all, O

one O
may O
need O

subsequently O

the O

the O

the O
two O

In O

There O

three O

First, O
some O

This O
is O
virtually O
impossible O
for O

so O
we O

use O
a ρ0. O
Second, O
some O
pairs O

by O
SU(3) O
in O

only O
if O

However, O
there O
are O
no O
P's O
which O
are O
pure O
(ss¯). O
The O
mesons O

an O

but O
they O

SU(3) O
in O
the O
SM B-Material
if O
the O
final O

involves O
an O
e B-Material
or η′. O
We O
therefore O
consider O
instead O
the O
vector O
meson O
ϕ B-Material
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
pure O
(ss¯) O
qu O
vector B-Material
meson I-Material
n B-Material
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
pure O
(ss¯) O
quark O
state. O
Finally, O
we O
require O
that O
both O
B0 O
and O
B O
quark B-Process
state I-Process
B0 B-Material
and O
t B-Material
h I-Material
be O
able O
to O
decay O
to O
the O

This O
cannot O
happen O
if O
the O
decay B-Process
to I-Process
the I-Process
final I-Process
state I-Process
single O
K0 O
(or O
K¯0) O
meson B-Material
. O
However, O
it O
can O
occur O
if O
this O
final-state B-Material
particle I-Material
is O
an O
excited B-Material
neutral I-Material
kaon I-Material
. O
In O
this O
case O
one O
decay O
involves O
K*0 B-Material
, O
while O
the O
other O
has O
a B-Material
it I-Material
. O
Assuming O
that O
the O
vector O
meson O
is O
detected O
via O
its O
decay O
to O
ψKsπ0 O
(as O
vector B-Material
meson I-Material
Bd0(t)→J/ψK*), B-Process
(as O
in O
the O
measurement O
of O

then O
both O
B O
0 B-Process
and I-Process
B¯0 I-Process
can I-Process
decay I-Process
to O
the O

B0 B-Material
can O
decay O

decay B-Process
decays B-Process
are O
written O
in O
terms O
of O
VV O
final O
states, O
while O
others O
are O
have O
PP states. O
There O
are O
three O
reasons O
for O
this. O
First, O
some O
decays B-Process
involve O
a O
final-state π0. O
However, O
experimentally O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
find O
the O
decay O
vertices O
of O
the O
final B-Material
particles I-Material
. O
This O
is O
virtually O
impossible O
for O
a π0, O
and O
so O
we O
always O
use O
a ρ0. O
Second, O
some O
pairs B-Material
of I-Material
decays I-Material
are O
related O
by O
SU(3) O
in O
the O
SM B-Material
only O
if O
an O
(ss¯) O
quark O
pair O
is O
used. O
However, O
there O
are O
no O
P's O
which O
are O
pure O
(ss¯). O
The O
mesons O
η O
and O
η′ O
have O
an O
(ss¯) O
component, O
but O
they O
also O
have O
significant O
(uu¯) O
and O
(dd¯) O
pieces. O
As O
a O
result O
the O
b¯→s¯ O
and O
b¯→d¯ O
decays O
are O
not O
really O
related O
by O
SU(3) O
in O
the O
SM O
if O
the O
final O
state O
involves O
an O
η O
or η′. O
We O
therefore O
consider O
instead O
the O
vector O
meson O
ϕ O
which O
is O
essentially O
a O
pure O
(ss¯) O
quark B-Material
state. O
Finally, O
we O
require O
that O
both O
B0 O
and O
B¯0 O
be O
able O
to O
decay O
to O
the O
final O
state. O
This O
cannot O
happen O
if O
the O
final O
state O
contains O
a O
single O
K0 O
(or O
K¯0) O
meson. O
However, O
it O
can O
occur O
if O
this O
final-state O
particle O
is O
an O
excited O
neutral O
kaon. O
In O
this O
case O
one O
decay O
involves O
K*0, O
while O
the O
other O
has O
K¯*0. O
Assuming O
that O
the O
vector O
meson O
is O
detected O
via O
its O
decay O
to O
ψK*), B-Material
then O
both O
B0 O
and O
B¯0 O
can O
decay O
to O
the O

Regarding O

all O

such O

WSNs B-Process

the O

However, O

the O

Ref. [15] O

that O
there O

no O

From O
this O
observation O
they O
concluded O
that O
the O
2SC O

absent O
in O
compact B-Material

In O

this O
result, O
it O

in O
Ref. [16] O
in O

that O

could O
be O
the O

a O

However, O
the O
authors O
argued O
that O
this O

disappear O
if O
the O

included O
more O

This O

indeed O
what O
we O

while O

the O

only O

Nevertheless, O
if O

this O

it O
will O
be O
this O

We O
describe O
three O
ways O
to O
solve O
the O
reflection B-Task
problem I-Task
. O
The O
first O
way O
is O
very O
simple O
(Section  O
4). O
We O
exploit O
the O
consequences O
of O
shifting B-Process
the I-Process
semi-infinite I-Process
row I-Process
by O
one O
period O
(to O
the O
right O
or O
left). O
In O
effect, O
we O
regard O
the O
semi-infinite B-Process
row I-Process
as O
two B-Process
scatterers I-Process
, O
one O
of O
which O
is O
another O
semi-infinite B-Process
row I-Process
. O
This O
idea O
goes O
back O
to O
a O
series O
of O
papers O
by O
Millar O
in O
the O
1960s, O
starting O
with  O
[2]. O
He O
used O
it O
for O
several O
two-dimensional B-Task

. O
A O
similar O
approach O
was O
used O
for O
layered B-Material
media I-Material
by O
Shenderov  O
[3]. O
In O
our O
one-dimensional O
context, O
we O
obtain B-Process
a I-Process
quadratic I-Process
equation I-Process
for O
R; O
we O
show O
how O
to O
select O
the O
correct O
solution. O
We O
remark O
that O
there O
has O
been O
much O

in O

From O

be O
divided O

types O
