When O
we O
formulate O
the O

a O

problem, O
we O
face, O
however, O
the O

problems. O
Minimizing O
the O
sum O
of O

objectives O
is O
problematic, O
since O
they O
may O
have O
different O
units O
and O
ranges. O
Even O
with O
an O
appropriate O
scaling B-Process
procedure I-Process
there O
is O
a O
risk O
of O
treating O
the O
objectives O
unequally O
or O
getting O
trapped O
in O
a O
local O
minimum. O
Firstly, O
we O
can O
never O
know, O
what O
is O
the O
minimum O
value O
of O
each O
objective O
that O
can O
be O
achieved O
by O
the O
regression. O
Thus, O
designing O
an O
appropriate O
scaling B-Process
procedure I-Process
is O
difficult O
and O
one O
would O
need O
to O
decide O
on O
the O
relative O
importance O
of O
the O
different O
objectives O
in O
advance. O
Secondly, O
adding O
multiple, O
conflicting O
objectives O
very O
likely O
results O
in O
a O
fitness O
function O
with O
multiple O
local O
minima, O
which O
makes O
optimization B-Process
more O
difficult. O
To O
